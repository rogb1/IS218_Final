# Final IS218 Project

Hello, I am Roger and I chose feature #9 User Profile Management. These past months in this course have been completely different than any other class. Working on a project for 25+ hours is something I have never done. The first project was very challenging as well. It was really awesome, though, to have an interactive calculator. I have only made very simple ones, which sort of helped, but this was definitely different. The most challenging part has been learning from HW10 and beyond for me. Honestly, it has been very challenging but has helped me understand more. During this project, I faced many issues and challenges, just like in the last one. Seeing insight on how software engineers act in the instruction videos was also pretty cool. My main challenge was the test cases. I tried my best, but I had to keep tweaking and revising them to get everything working right. Incorporating the Mailtrap account was also a tough part of the project. I struggled with several issues that I couldn’t fully resolve, and it made the learning process feel like a real test of patience.

This class also taught me that I need to step it up and focus on learning on my own more. It is crucial to play around with new topics in class to understand them better and to apply those skills in real-world scenarios. I’ve realized that you really have to get comfortable with uncertainty and trial and error, especially in the tech field. Additionally, I learned that working on my time management skills is necessary. In a project of this scale, it’s easy to get behind or miss small details. Managing time effectively allows for a smoother workflow and ensures that all tasks, even the smaller ones, are completed.

One thing I also learned was how to handle failure and frustration more effectively. Not everything works the first time. Its part of the learning process, and it taught me how to approach problems differently when things don’t go as planned. It wasn’t always easy, but every challenge was an opportunity to improve. Being able to reflect on my mistakes and figure out solutions is progress.

This class overall has been my most challenging along with IT114. The balance between theory and practice has been difficult, but I’ve appreciated the real-world applications we’ve worked on. I hope that next semester, I can incorporate the skills and knowledge that I have learned here into new projects. I feel more confident now and I know that I will continue to grow from the lessons I have learned in this course. Thank you, professor, and have an awesome break!
